### Design
-   #### Colour Scheme
    The main colour I have chosen for the site is pink. It is one of my favourite colours and is warm and inviting.   
    I have chosen a dark slate grey to contrast with this an provide an easily legible font colour.  
    I have added an additional turquoise colour, another favourite colour of mine, to use for touches and to add another colour aspect.   
    I have kept the body white and also added a black colour for clear contrast on the main body of the site.

    Here is the colour palete generated on [Colormind](http://colormind.io/).
