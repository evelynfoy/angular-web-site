# angular-web-site

<p>The goal of this project was to build a website in Angular in order to practise what I had learnt <br>
in the Angular course  I have just completed and to introduce myself and showcase my projects. </p>
<p>
The home page details some of my qualifications and the projects page lists some of my more recent projects. <br>
There is also a project page which details a particular projects and displays an image.<br>
There is an authentication page which you can sign into using the email address guest@guest.com and password Guest@200.<br>
This allows you to add,edit and delete projects. </p>

# Wireframes
I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop some wireframes for my website. 

The wireframes are below:

### [Components Wireframe](docs/wireframes/Components.png "Components wireframe")
### [Home Wireframe](docs/wireframes/Home.png "Home wireframe")
### [Projects Wireframe](docs/wireframes/Projects.png "Projects wireframe")

## Features 

- The site is entirely written in angular. It uses routing and forms.
- It has a firebase backend where the projects are written and retrieved from.
- It has authentcation and users can loggin using a guest signon displayed on the login screen.
- When signed in guest users can add,edit and delete any guest projects but not any I added myself as administrator.
- Projects added by guests are marked as such with Guest: added to the name and 'Added by guest:' added to the description line.
- Projects added by guests are not displayed unless you are logged in.  


## Agile Implementation
- I implemented this project as an agile project which I set up in github - Develop Web Site
- I did it over two sprints which I set up as milestones.
- I created issues for all the features of the projects. In total 42 issues.
- I used a Kanban board to progress my issues and I used branches for the development work.


## Design
-   #### Colour Scheme
    The main colour I have chosen for the site is pink. It is one of my favourite colours and is warm and inviting.   
    I have chosen a dark slate grey to contrast with this an provide an easily legible font colour.  
    I have added an additional turquoise colour, another favourite colour of mine, to use for touches and to add another colour aspect.   
    I have kept the body white and also added a black colour for clear contrast on the main body of the site.

    Here is the colour palete generated on [Colormind](http://colormind.io/).
